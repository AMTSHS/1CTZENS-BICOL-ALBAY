<h3> Bicol Express </h3>
<hr>
<p> This creamy and savory meal often contains pork, shrimp paste, tomatoes, onions, green chile, and coconut milk. It also has the appropriate amount of heat to give it a kick. This dish tastes best when paired with plain rice and is available in almost every karinderya and restaurant in Bicol. But if you're feeling particularly daring, Bicol Express can also be combined with pasta sauce. </p>

<h3> Sili Ice Cream </h3>
<hr>
<p>  Sili Ice cream's velvety, frozen texture is broken up by a dash of spiciness from the tastes of chile and coconut milk. If the spiciness worries you, you can select from four levels of spiciness based on your tolerance for heat.  </p>
